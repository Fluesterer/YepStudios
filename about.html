      <p>Hey, I'm a 12-year-old kid who loves creating games and building fun stuff. It's something I truly enjoy — and it's more than just a hobby to me.</p>

      <p>When I was 9, we moved to a new place, and everything changed. My parents were arguing almost every day, sometimes really loud — glass-shattering loud. I couldn’t sleep well, and I ended up going to therapy. One day, my brother and I left the house crying. It was one of the hardest moments of my life.</p>

      <p>Game development and playing games became my escape — a way to feel joy again. Even when things were rough, I still had to go to school, where I was bullied a lot without anyone noticing. But through it all, making games gave me something I could control, something that made me happy.</p>

      <p>Yep Studios is my little world where I can create, explore, and be myself. Thanks for being here.</p>
