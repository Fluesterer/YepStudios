      <h2>About Flusterer</h2>
      <p>Hey, I'm a 12-year-old kid who loves creating games and building fun stuff. It's something I truly enjoy — and it's more than just a hobby to me.</p>
      <p>When I was 9, we moved to a new place, and everything changed. My parents were arguing almost every day, sometimes really loud — glass-shattering loud. I couldn’t sleep well, and I ended up going to therapy. One day, my brother and I left the house crying. It was one of the hardest moments of my life.</p>
      <p>Game development and playing games became my escape — a way to feel joy again. Even when things were rough, I still had to go to school, where I was bullied a lot without anyone noticing. But through it all, making games gave me something I could control, something that made me happy.</p>
      <p>Yep Studios is my little world where I can create, explore, and be myself. Thanks for being here.</p>

      <h2>About Schleimiger</h2>
      <p>I'm a passionate programmer, game developer, and all-around creative mind who blends technical skill with pure energy. Whether I’m building immersive horror experiences in Unity or remixing tracks with a touch of humor and chaos – I do it with a unique flair.</p>
      <p>Known for projects like <strong>Paralysis</strong>, remix bangers like <em>"Einmal um die Zone"</em>, and iconic <strong>Descenders</strong> maps with thousands of downloads, I thrive on pushing boundaries. From coding custom server systems to creating 3D Blender models of my own characters – I'm always cooking up something wild. And let me tell you: I always have a backup plan when things don’t go as expected.</p>
      <p>With a sharp eye for detail and a love for storytelling that hits different, I’m not just building games – I’m building worlds. In 2025, I’m launching <strong>SlimeCraft</strong>, my own Minecraft server featuring Citybuild, Murder Mystery, Floor is Lava, and more – all fully scripted with zero pay-to-win nonsense. It’s Minecraft the way it should be: creative, fair, and community-driven.</p>
      <p>I really like playing Fortnite too. But let’s be honest – it’s not always fun. (insert display smash sound effect)</p>
      <p>And whether you catch me designing yet another useless website in JavaScript or experimenting with artificial intelligence, one thing’s for sure: it’s gonna be weird, it’s gonna be fun, and it’s gonna be very me.</p>
